2P SNAKE
========

01.23.2015
This is a simple two-player snake game, (re)created by Megan Chao, Arden Marin, and Lisa Deng.

Player 1 is the red arrow and uses the WASD keys to move.
Player 2 is the blue arrow and uses the arrow keys to move.

Don't bump into the black obstacles, the trails, or the other player! Only white tiles are safe.
1 point is awarded for surviving longer than the other player; if you both die during the same turn, no points are awarded.
The game continues indefinitely, but you can close the window or use Esc to quit.

Just run the 2psnake.py file to play! (But be careful, the game starts immediately after you run the code)

Feel free to contact Megan (megchao@mit.edu) if you have any suggestions or find any bugs.
