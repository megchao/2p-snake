This is a simple two-player snake game, programmed by Megan Chao, Arden Marin, and Lisa Deng.

Player 1 is the red arrow and uses the WASD keys to move.
Player 2 is the blue arrow and uses the arrow keys to move.

Don't bump into the black obstacles, the trails, or the other player! Only white tiles are safe.

Just run the project.py file to play! (But be careful, the game starts immediately after you run the code)
